# Mindloggers Console App (Pre-Build)

This is the pre-build of the Mindloggers app, a Calendar app that allows you to do the following: <br />
<ul>
  <li>View calendar in day or month view</li>
  <li>Create a new event (one time ocurrance or regularly occuring)</li>
  <li>Go to a specific event</li>
  <li>Delete events</li>
  <li>Quit</li>
</ul>

There is not a stable executable as of yet, so the project will need to be built using an IDE.

Building the Project:

Downdload the zip file
Unzip into desired folder
Import/Open the unpacked folder into desired IDE
Build or run from the program


Example Output: <br />
